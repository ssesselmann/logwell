RASPBERRY PI SINGLE BUTTON RECORDING DEVICE
-------------------------------------------
This program runs automatically after boot and waits for an input on pin 33 
If True then records the stereo input from a USB sound card (Line In)
and saves the file to disc with the filename YYMMDD-HHMMSS.wav
stops recording when pin 33 is True and loops.
